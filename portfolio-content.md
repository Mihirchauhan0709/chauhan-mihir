## Short Bio (Use on Homepage)

I am Mihir Chauhan, a Data Science graduate student at CU Boulder with industry and research experience building end-to-end AI systems. My work spans applied machine learning, LLM-driven pipelines, data engineering, and cloud-native infrastructure. I have built production-style platforms like CloudSense (AI code review automation) and an AI Interview Coach, and I have also worked on clinical NLP and LLM infographic generation as a Research Intern at CU Anschutz. I enjoy shipping practical AI solutions and communicating results clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
